# Raspberry Pi RP2040 Projects

This repository showcases a diverse collection of Python scripts developed during my internship, highlighting practical implementations in IoT and embedded systems. From controlling LEDs (LED light blinking.py, gp2 and gp3 light.py) and creating interactive button and buzzer setups (button.py, button and buzzer.py, buzzer.py) to integrating temperature sensors with Firebase for real-time data logging (firebase temp sensor with led.py, temp sensor in firebase.py), these projects reflect hands-on learning and innovation. The repository also includes ultrasonic sensor applications for distance measurement and triggering actions (ultra sonic in Lcd.py, ultra sonic with buzzer and relay and led.py), along with IoT cloud communication via Firebase and Thingspeak (firebase console.py, thingspeak.py). Additional utilities, such as timers and counters (counter Lcd.py, countdown.py, counting.py), and scripts for light frequency monitoring and relay control, demonstrate a well-rounded approach to solving real-world challenges. These projects, completed as part of my internship experience, are designed to be modular and adaptable, making them an excellent resource for developers, students, and hobbyists looking to explore IoT and hardware programming.
